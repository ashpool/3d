# Summary

****New design is out. Compatibility with the multicolor upgrade is still not available****
The new design should have no interference with your cable setup for the printer carriage. It also features the same design pattern as the rest of the printer.

The old design files are re-uploaded per request.

************
This is my custom made case for the Raspberry Pi computers for those that want to run a 3D print server like [OctoPrint](http://octoprint.org/).

************

The case is mounted on the back side of the frame, just above the electronics with Z clearance in mind. The Z axis can hit the maximum level without any issues on neither the Z axis or the X carriage.

There is also a slot ready for using the Raspberry Pi camera if you want to monitor your prints.

Combined with a WiFi USB dongle this makes for a very portable printer!

# Print Settings

Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: Yes
Infill: 20%

Notes: 
0,2 mm layer height works good. The design is optimized for a 0,4 mm nozzle.

# Installation

## Hardware requirements/installation

4x M3x16 screws for the case
2x M3x8 screws for attaching the case to the frame.

First install the Lid.stl onto the frame using the two M3x8 screws. Then attach the Base.stl/Base_rasp3_NoSpringSDSlot.stl to the lid using the four M3x16 screws.
