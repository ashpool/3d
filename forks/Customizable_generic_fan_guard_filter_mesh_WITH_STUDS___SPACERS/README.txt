# Summary

This adds studs to the customizable fan guard by MoonCactus.

The problem with the original is that it creates an airtight seal aroung the fan perimiter which blocks the airflow from the side and thus creates a lot of noise.

With the studs there is a gap between the guard and the fan housing and doesn't create noise.

How to use studs: 
Most fans have a recessed larger part of the hole to fit the screw head flush. Measure the width and depth of this countersink hole and enter the corresponding parameters. The stud/pin length must be larger than the depth of the recessed hole! I suggest 2-3mm more than you measure. This is the gap between the guard and the fan.

If you want friction fit, make the studs diameter a bit larger.

The same limitations as the original design apply.
