# Summary

<b>Note:</b> Test-fit before gluing. Assembly guide may have wrong order of steps, so use it just to understand orientation and what goes where. Feel free to post and share your finished prints with the rest of us!

<b>8/7/2017:</b>
Some users give useful tips in the comments. Printing handles vertically give better finish. Support is recommended for Parts 20, 21, 29, and 32. Part 11 (grip pin) might be 4 mm too long. Part 18 (crossbar pin) may be too thin. A quick fix for these pins is sanding or adding tape.

<b>3/4/2017:</b>
Re-oriented 05_boltStop_v2.stl; Split scope into 23_scopeA.stl and 23_scopeB.stl

<b>1/8/2017:</b>

Added 01_barrel_v2.stl and 09_receiver_v4.stl to address tight fit.

<b>1/7/2017:</b>

Added 09_receiver_v3.stl to address mystery disc void.

<b>1/3/2017:</b>

Added 09_receiver_v2.stl to feature mystery disc detail and stronger grip.

<b>Introduction</b>

This is a 3D-printable replica of Han Solo’s DL-44 Heavy Blaster from Star Wars: A New Hope. Through my extensive research and effort, this is the most accurate 3D-printable DL-44 replica designed for ease of print and fine detail. In the images above is a comparison between this 3D printed design and one of the few existing reference materials for the screen-used DL-44.

The stl files are already oriented correctly, but make sure to download and read the included ‘3Dprinted_dl44_assemblyGuide .pdf’ for all the print settings and assembly instructions.  For those of you who do not own a 3D printer, check out local printing services near you through 3D Hubs.

# Post-Printing

Some acrylic paint and foam brush was used to give the final print some color.


# How I Designed This

The screen-used DL-44 was built using many World War 2 components like the Mauser C96 “Bolo” variant, German Hensoldt & Wetzlar Ziel Dialyth 3x sniper scope, and MG81 aircraft-mounted machine gun flash hider. All of these real-world components are rare and cost thousands of dollars and inaccessible to many of us, so I poured hundreds of hours to capture accurate details on Google, AskMisterScience’s extensive guide on Mauser C-96s, and the Replica Prop Forum. 

The parts press-fit together and are cleverly designed in Autodesk Fusion 360 to be seamless without the use of body filler. Superglue (cyanoacrylate) will ensure the prop stays in one piece, especially for cosplay purposes. This model also comes with a working trigger mechanism that uses a standard rubberband.
