The recorder is one of the oldest woodwind instruments. In the hands of an experienced player it creates a sound synonymous with Renaissance music. Often used in elementary music classes because of it's ease of operation. With 3D printing everyone can have one of their own to make beautiful music on... or wailing screeches if they never got past "hot crossed buns".

# Instructions

1. Print recorderv2.2.stl with high infill. (Alternately you can print the individual parts.)  

2. <strong>Sharpen the edge of the lip to a fine point.</strong>  

3. Assemble.  

4. Twist the foot to adjust for comfortable pinky finger placement.  

5. The top of the body and the mouthpiece is connected with a longer connecter to allow for some tuning.  

6. Note that if you start with all holes covered and remove them one-by-one that the high notes are going to sound flat. That is normal. To get the proper tones for all the notes use the key chart on en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recorder#Recorder_fingering .
