# Summary

Another implementation of letters-on-spikes, but contrasting in several points:

* good customisability
* Stronger joints. Those use my joints lib http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1764043
* Decent, symmetrical peg points for smooth ground penetration action 

Finding a visually pleasing font which is available on thingiverse is still a challenge. None of those tentatively specified appear to be available. I've settled for three Google fonts "Lobster", "Pacifico" and "Chewy" now.
The font I use mostly for these signs is http://www.dafont.com/chinacat.font, regular type, which can be set to make the letters touch slightly without merging into each other a lot, which gives a good balance between mechanical stability and readability. It also has a less austere look to generated text then the more edgy defaultish and commonish alternatives.
Another font I like for this application is http://www.dafont.com/fennario.font, especially if a capital G is involved - chinacat capital G can easily be mistaken for a C, as can be seen in this example: http://www.dafont.com/chinacat.font?text=Gurken&psize=l - Fennario capital G features a much more distinct horizontal stroke: http://www.dafont.com/fennario.font?text=Gurken&psize=l
I'd like to hear about which fonts you favour for this item, as I would like to take a look at them myself.
