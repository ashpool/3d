# Summary

DJI Spark Gimbal cover.

I wanted to design a cover purely for my own enjoyment. I wanted something functional, but that looked and felt better than the square ones already on here.

I came up with this, after about 6 revisions, it is where you see it now.

It is formed to the body nicely, it clips in behind the gimbal to the main body and holds on,
it also covers the lower sensors too.

Enjoy!

# Print Settings

Printer: Anycubic Plus
Rafts: No
Resolution: 0.2
Infill: 60

Notes: 
Printed in ABS to ensure strength, PLA is ok too, but it might be a bit weak, Can also print in TPU if your printer is dialed in correctly.

PETG would be an alternative to ABS, although as it is brittle, it may crack where the clips are.
