# Summary

This is my gift to you for today's Saint Nicholas Day. In addition to the 6 sample models from the pictures as .stl files, I also provide a customizer, about which you can create your own Christmas trees.
If you're interested in some more christmas themed models, then check out my [Christmas collection](https://www.thingiverse.com/mightynozzle/collections/christmas). Follow me, if you want to be informed about a new part of this series!

####Customizable Settings

- number of horizontal segments
- number of  sides
