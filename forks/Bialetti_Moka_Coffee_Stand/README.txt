# Summary

I recently started brewing my coffee the *proper* way, using a Bialetti Moka Express. You might know it as an "espresso" maker (despite the fact *technically* it's not really espresso due to the lack of pressure!)

I found that there was often times I'd like to be able to prepare the coffee in the funnel part without it being inserted into the lower half of the Moka Pot. The main reason being that if in a hurry, preboiling the water in the kettle leads less time sitting on the stove (I always have it *Americano* so the kettle needs to be boiled too anyway.)

I created this stand so that I could have the funnel kept upright and stable without needing to be inside the pot (once in there, you can't get the blighter out without spilling your grounds everywhere.) It has a nice wide base and I've tested it with the funnels from pots that can brew up to four cups. I added a tiny hole at the bottom so any drips of water don't collect inside the part and it's all open so that you won't every get a build up of coffee grounds either. Finally, the top is *bowled*[?] out so that it sits in really nicely and there is even space for the lip right where the tube meets the basket (if your pot has one.)

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: RepRap
Printer: P3Steel
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.2mm or lower
Infill: 30-40%

Notes: 
This part gets used multiple times a day in our house so needed to be really rugged and reliable. So I printed with **4 outer shells, 4 top and bottom solid layers and 40% infill.**

I also wanted it to be aesthetically pleasing, so I used **Concentric** top and bottom solid layer patterns, which makes it look really attractive, too (one of the reasons I really prefer Sli3R to Cura is the control over the end finish.)

Mine is printed in Silver PLA from Rigid.ink but really it doesn't matter what you use. It won't ever get hot so use whatever is to hand. Printing at 0.2mm or lower will make sure that the curves are all well smoothed and makes it look more pleasing overall.
